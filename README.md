# Knn-and-Naive-Bayes-model-Prediction
This Repository contains two notebooks.
The first notebook contains a model prediction of the titanic dataset as to whether a passenger survived or did not.

Quick Stats

The RMS Titanic was a British made luxury ship that was owned by White Star company and built by Belfast shipbuilding firm Harland and Wolff. The ship set asail its maiden voyage from England with its final destination as New York. The first stop that the ship made was at Cherbourg in France, picked a few passangers and headed to its second last stop at Queenstown in Ireland with a passenger count of 1300 and a crew of 900. The Titanic was captained by Edward J. Smith, known as the Millionaires Captain. At 11.40 PM, the ship struck an iceberg approximately 740 km south of Newfoundland, Canada. And at approximately 2.20 AM, the ship sunk dissapearing beneath the Atlantic ocean. Apporximately 1500 people were killed comprised of 700 crew members. Out of the 710 3rd class members, only 174 survived. This research project aims at deriving insights on the passengers that were onboard the titanic and try and predict whether a patient survived or not using the given variables.

The second notebook tries to classify whether a message is spam or ham. The dataset used is already pre-processed and therefore after deriving the insights I delve right into building the model.
